# volume-normalizer
Simple python script to take an input folder of music and copy it to an output folder, but with the volume normalized across the collection.

## How To Use
Simply run the script as

`python3 src/main.py [input_directory] [output_directory]`

## Notes
- I have only tested this with mp3s because I am lazy.
- This will not overwrite any files.
- This does not normalize the volume within any individual tracks.
